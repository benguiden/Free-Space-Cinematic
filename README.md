# Free-Space-Cinematic

To use VR Functionality, disable the MainCamera gameobject, enable the CameraRig gameobject.

Cinematic Pitch:
	The models are ripped from mods of the classic PC
	game Free Space, sadly I haven't had time to play
	through many of the missions so I won't be able to
	base the cinematic off the game's story and world.
	The cinematic will feature a huge ship making its way
	to some sort of jump node accompanied by small
	escort ships, the good guys represented by the Proton
	ship and the Banshee ship. The fleet will get intercepted
	by the bad guys represented by the Intercepter ship
	and the Bomber ship. I would love to have some dog
	fighting between the smaller ships as eventually the
	bomber ships manager to destroy the big one. At which
	point it would be cool to see some escape pods fly
	towards the planet then and have the huge ship explode.
	Each model comes with detached broken parts of the
	ships which I can enable when the ships blow up and
	show off some really cool explosions.
